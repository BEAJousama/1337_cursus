		In this repo I publish projects I worked on in my cursus at 1337-Khouribga

			    || ---------------------------------------- ||

	* PROJECT 1 : LIBFT
	____________________

	This project is about re-writing highly useful standard functions of C language and archiving them
	into a library called libft.
	
	
	* PROJECT 2 : GET_NEXT_LINE
	___________________________
	
	The objectif of this project is to create a function that returns the next line of a file every time it
	get called, this will be very helpful if we want to process files line by line.


	* PROJECT 3 : FT_PRINTF
	________________________
	
	The idea behind this project is to code the printf function as defined by the linux system. 
	I handled the 'csdpiuxX%' specifiers without flags.
	To do : add 'f' specifier to support floats, and handle the flags..

	
	* PROJECT 4 : MINITALK
	________________________
	
	This project is an introduction to linux signals programming, the idea is to create a client-server
	communication using linux signals (SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2).

	
	* PROJECT 5 : PUSHSWAP
	________________________
	
	This project is about sorting a stack using only one other empty stack, with limited operations.
	
	
	* PROJECT 6 : SOLONG
	________________________
	
	This project is an introduction to game programming with C language, it is a simple 2D game created 
	with the use of a library called MiniLibX (a tiny graphics library).
	
	
	* PROJECT 7 : PHILOSOPHERS
	________________________
	
	This project is an introduction to concurrent programming with C language,
