		In this repo I publish projects I worked on in my cursus at 1337-Khouribga

			    || ---------------------------------------- ||

	* PROJECT 1 : LIBFT
	____________________

	This project is about re-writing highly useful standard functions of C language and archiving them
	into a library called libft.

	* PROJECT 2 : GET_NEXT_LINE
	___________________________
	
	The objectif of this project is to create a function that returns the next line of a file every time it
	get called, this will be very helpful if we want to process files line by line.
